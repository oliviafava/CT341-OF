                    <p>In the fourth quarter of 2021, Snap reported $1.3 billion in revenue (up 42% year over year), an operating loss of$25.1 million, and GAAP net income of $22.6 million. On behalf of all the mean things that I have written about Snap’s long and occasionally meandering path to profitability, I would like to say congrats.</p>
