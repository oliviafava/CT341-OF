                <h1>Snap finally did it, y'all</h1>
                <p>And we don’t mean adjusted-EBITDA profitable, adjusted-operating-income 
                profitable, or even the infamous non-GAAP-net-income profitable. It’s 
                real-profit profitable.</p>
                <p>In the fourth quarter of 2021, Snap reported $1.3 billion 
                in revenue (up 42% year over year), an operating loss of
                $25.1 million, and GAAP net income of $22.6 million. On behalf of all 
                the mean things that I have written about Snap’s long and occasionally 
                meandering path to profitability, I would like to say congrats.</p>
